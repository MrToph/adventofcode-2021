# Advent Of Code 2021

> Boilerplate forked from [tejasbusbane](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2021)

I'm learning Rust by solving the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

I'd be happy about feedback on how to do something "_the Rust way_", feel free to raise issues on this repo.

### Usage

This is a library crate (no executable). Sample and puzzle inputs are hard-coded in tests.

Build project and run tests:

```bash
cargo test
# run only day1 tests + see println statements
cargo test day1 -- --nocapture
```
